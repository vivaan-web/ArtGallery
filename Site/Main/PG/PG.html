        <h3>Password Creation Guidelines</h3>

    </div>
    <p>I ensure your security at Vivaanwiz.com, but passwords 
    are your choice and I would like to guide you on creating them.
    Here are the characteristics of a strong password:
    <ul>
        <li>Has 8-12 characters or more. <br> (More characters, the strong it is)</li>
        <li>Is comprised of:
            <ol>
                <br>
                <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-sm">
                    <thead class="light">
                        <tr class="table-dark">
                            <th scope="col">#</th>
                            <th scope="col">Characters</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="row">1</th>
                            <th scope="col">Lowercase letters (a-z)</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="row">2</th>
                            <th scope="col">Uppercase letters (A-Z)</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="row">3</th>
                            <th scope="col">Numbers (0-9)</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr class="align-top">
                            <th scope="row">4</th>
                            <th scope="col">Special Characters:<br>
                                            `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]\{}|;':",./<>?
                            </th>
                        </tr>           
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Google has a secure password generator that works on many sites
    All you need is Google Chrome browser and a google account. This feature
    is likely to be added to other browsers too, so keep an eye on it.

    <h3>Why should a password be secure?</h3>
    The reason secure passwords are important is because of data integrity
    and security. If you had confidential information on your computer and
    someone knew the pin or password, they cen get hold of information
    they aren't supposed to have. Getting hacked is a big problem, especially
    with social media. If someone is in your social media account and is
    impersonating you and acting all strange. 
    But the biggest problem is with financial passwords. If people
    get in to your bank account, they can use your money without your
    permission, that is also why you don't reply to spam and use sketchy
    websites. When going through websites, check if the website you are on has
    https enabled, if not, don't use it unless you need to. This website does
    have https enabled. Older versions of it though, did not.

    <H3>PI</H3>
    What is PI? PI is personal information. On the internet, keep away from sharing
    your PI to others, PI is anything that can be used to identify you and that is
    why you shouldn't share it with others. Why is sharing PI dangerous? A number of
    reasons! 
    <ul>
        <li>identity theft</li>
        <li>Spam</li>
        <li>Phishing</li>
    </ul>
    The weird thing is you don't even need a social media or network account to be
    subject to sharing PI. If you do have an account, you don't even have to be
    online!
